# Currency Exchange Rate Prediction

International students struggle with fluctuating currency exchange rates affecting expenses like tuition fees and remittances.​ The project aims to develop machine learning models predicting exchange rates among key regions: US, India, Europe, UK, and Japan.​ Forecasting rates enables students to make informed financial decisions, managing expenses amidst currency fluctuations.​

## Data set

The dataset used in this currency exchange rate prediction project is from Yahoo Finance containing historical data for over 4 years (2020-present) on the countries' exchange rates. ​The "Close" column contains the target values that the ML model aims to predict. ​

## Methodology

1. ARIMA​: A time series forecasting model that captures linear relationships and temporal dependencies in the data.​
2. SARIMA​: An extension of the ARIMA model that includes additional seasonal AR and MA terms to capture seasonal variations and trends.​
3. XGBoost:​ It combines multiple decision trees to create a robust predictive model using gradient boosting to optimize the performance of individual trees in each iteration.​
4. Convolutional Neural Network​: In time series forecasting, CNNs can learn hierarchical representations of input sequences, capturing both short-term and long-term patterns.​
